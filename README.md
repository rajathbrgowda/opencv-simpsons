## Overview
This project delves into deep computer vision techniques to classify characters from the renowned TV series, "The Simpsons". Leveraging a vast dataset of "The Simpsons" images and implementing advanced preprocessing methods via OpenCV, this project strives for optimal recognition capabilities.

## Description & Actions
- **Model Development**: A robust deep learning model forms the foundation of this project.
- **Data Source**: The model was trained on images featuring characters from "The Simpsons."
- **Image Preprocessing**: Utilized OpenCV for tasks such as:
  - Color space transformations: Normalizing and enhancing image features for improved recognition.
  - Edge Detection: Accentuating boundaries and unique character feature bolster the model's classification capability.
